Installing Poco for OS X (10.4 or higher) with XCode

Theo changes:
i) library is now 10.4 and 10.5 compatible
ii) library is now universal (ppc and intel)

---

1. Put the folder in your 'libs' folder.

2. In Project -> Edit Project Settings -> Build Add ../../libs/poco/include to the "Header Search Paths" 
   (make sure you have it set for all configurations)

3. Create a new group called poco inside "libs/other libs" in "Groups and Files"
From the finder drag all the .a files in ../poco/lib folder to your poco group 
(choose relative to project as the reference type).
