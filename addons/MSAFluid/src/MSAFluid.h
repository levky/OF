/***********************************************************************
 
 * this is a class for solving real-time fluid dynamics simulations based on Navier-Stokes equations 
 * and code from Jos Stam's paper "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games" http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf
 * Other useful resources and implementations I looked at while building this lib: 
 * Mike Ash (C) - http://mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html
 * Alexander McKenzie (Java) - http://www.multires.caltech.edu/teaching/demos/java/stablefluids.htm
 * Pierluigi Pesenti (AS3 port of Alexander's) - http://blog.oaxoa.com/2008/01/21/actionscript-3-fluids-simulation/
 * Gustav Taxen (C) - http://www.nada.kth.se/~gustavt/fluids/
 * Dave Wallin (C++) - http://nuigroup.com/touchlib/ (uses portions from Gustav's)
